MOTHER died today. Or, maybe, yesterday; I can't be sure. The telegram from the Home says:
YOUR MOTHER PASSED AWAY. FUNERAL TOMMOROW. DEEP SYMPATHY. Which leaves the matter doubtful;
it could have been yesterday. The Home for Aged Persons is at Marengo, some fifty miles from Algiers.
With the two o'clock bus i should get there well before nightfall. Then I can 
spend the night there, keeping the usual vigil beside the body, and be back here by tomorrow evening. 
I have fixed up with my employer for two days' leave; obviously, under the circumstances, 
he couldn't refuse. Still, I had an idea he looked annoyed, and I said, without thinking: 
"Sorry, sir, but it's not my fault, you know."
