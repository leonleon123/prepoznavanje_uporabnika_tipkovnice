To begin, place the game board on the table. Each player selects a token. 
Then they place their token on the table near the space labelled Go, placing 
it on Go only when their first turn to move arrives. One player becomes the Banker, 
who distributes assets from the Bank to the players. Only the player in question can 
use their money, money can only be lent via the Banker or by the player money. Each player 
is given $1,500 in cash divided as follows: two each of $500s, $100's and $50's; six $20's, 
five each of $10's, $5's and $1's. All remaining cash and other equipment go to the Bank. 
The Banker may play too but must keep his personal funds from the bank. He/she also needs 
to make sure that they collect $200 when they pass GO.
