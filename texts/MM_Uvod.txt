During the course of Mathematical Modelling the students will be solving (relatively) 
real life problems with the help of mathematical models. Students will be introduced to 
team work and will be given the opportunity to carry out a complete relatively complex 
project from the beginning to the very end  together with their colleagues (and with the help of the teaching team).
